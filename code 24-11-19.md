## Shopping Cart 

You are tasked to implement a system to manage items in a shopping cart. The cache supports the following operations:

1. **`put(item)`**: Adds an item to the cart. If the item already exists, it should be moved to the front of the cart.
2. **`remove(item)`**: Removes an item from the cart. If the item does not exist, do nothing.
3. **`view()`**: Displays all the items in the cart in the order of most recently added.
4. **`get(item)`**: Retrieves an item from the cart. If the item exists, it should be moved to the front of the cart; otherwise, return "-1".

The cart operations should mimic an LRU mechanism, where:
- The most recently used item appears at the front.
- The least recently used item appears at the end.

### Input:
The input consists of a series of operations to perform on the cart. Example operations include:
- `put` to add items to the cart.
- `remove` to remove items from the cart.
- `view` to display the current state of the cart.

### Output:
Print the contents of the cart after performing all operations.

### Example:

For the following operations:
```plaintext
put("soundbar")
put("airpods")
put("iphone")
view()
remove("airpods")
put("airpods max")
put("soundbar")
view()
```

### Output:
```plaintext
---- MY CART ----
iphone
airpods
soundbar

---- MY CART ----
soundbar
airpods max
iphone

```
