# Maximum Occurrence of Substrings

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `components` consisting of several characters. The goal is to determine the most frequently occurring substring within the string that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The length of the substring must lie in the inclusive range `[minLength, maxLength]`.
2. The number of unique characters in the substring must not exceed `maxUnique`.

### Input Parameters
- `components` (string): The input string containing the characters.
- `minLength` (int): The minimum length of the substring.
- `maxLength` (int): The maximum length of the substring.
- `maxUnique` (int): The maximum number of unique characters allowed in the substring.

### Output
- Return the frequency of the substring that appears the most and satisfies the conditions.

## Example

### Input
```python
components = "abcde"
minLength = 2
maxLength = 3
maxUnique = 3
```
### Output
```python
1
```

### Explanation:

All substrings of lengths in the range [2, 3] with at most 3 unique characters are considered.
Valid substrings are: "ab", "bc", "cd", "de", "abc", "bcd", "cde".
Each substring occurs only once, so the maximum frequency is 1.
